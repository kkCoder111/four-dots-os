# Four Dots OS

This is a Web OS simulator that is no longer in development (as of 2023). 
Features did break (that's for sure).
Check it out here: <https://kkcoder111.github.io/four-dots-os/>

Go to the wiki to check out some features which might be coming soon! :-)

*IMPORTANT: Unstable is no longer available. Untested changes should go in their own respective branch(es).*
